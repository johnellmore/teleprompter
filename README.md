# Teleprompter

This is a simple text "teleprompter" for use with laptops or monitors with a webcam just above the screen. It will show custom text centered near the top of your screen and slowly scroll through it. The scroll speed is controllable in real-time. The makes it easy to read your text while looking near the camera.
